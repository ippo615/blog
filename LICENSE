========================

Unless otherwise stated, all of the content posted here is released under the
following terms and conditions:

I. No Warranty:
---------------

I make no guarantees that any of the code, thoughts, illustrations, pictures,
applications, sounds and data (henceforth referred to as "stuff") created,
displayed or used by me will work. It will probably fail miserably most of the
time. Too bad! If you want something better: (a) make it yourself or (b) hire
someone to do it. Additionally, if any of the stuff fails in such a manner as
to damage your reputation, destroy your property or tickle your funny bone
then all I can say is "Sorry." I will not be held responsible for any of your
bad decisions (specifically: the one in which you choose to use my stuff to
make a mess of your life).

II. Your Rights:
----------------

You can use my stuff to do various actions. The possible actions are infinite;
therefore, I shall only list those which you are expressly PROHIBITED from
doing.

1. Thou shall not use my stuff to hurt, damage, belittle or otherwise make
   another sentient creature feel sub-optimal.
2. Thou shall not use my stuff to hurt, damage, belittle or otherwise make
   thy-self feel sub-optimal.
3. Thou shall not use my stuff to steal, coerce or barter various goods and/or
   services without my permission and blessing.
4. Thou shall not use my stuff without stating the following: "Portions Â©
   Andrew Ippoliti (ippo615)"

III. Derivative usage:
----------------------

Should you actually use my stuff to do better stuff then you must adhere to
the following:

1. Thou shall thank me!
2. Thou shall let me know what thou hast done or what thou plans to do.
3. Thou may present me with offerings (please no first-born children; how
   about cash? 10? 20? or a blank check)

IV: Errors:
-----------

I'm human so, obviously, I'm perfect but my computer makes the occasional
mistake. Should you notice any errors, please inform me of them. My computer
will be most gracious.

V. More:
--------

If you are reading or otherwise using my stuff and you are not: smiling,
learning, or otherwise having a good time then GO AWAY! Otherwise, continue:
you'll always be welcome here :-)

If you're really concerned about giving me proper credit then put the
following somewhere readable (ie your webpage, the "about" section of your
program, in the source): // Ippo615's Code - (C) Andrew Ippoliti //

=======================
Do what you want with my stuff but be nice, share, and let me know what
awesomeness you've done with it. Also it would be nice to give me credit if you
do use it (but I won't place a curse on your ancestors if you don't... or maybe
I will).
